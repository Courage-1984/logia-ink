# Logi-Ink Website

A cyberpunk-inspired marketing site for the Logi-Ink digital agency. The site ships as static HTML, modular CSS, and ES6 modules bundled with Vite, featuring rich motion design, PWA support, and an operational reports dashboard.

> **Must read first:** `.cursor/rules/cursorrules.mdc` is the canonical source for architecture, naming, and workflow rules. Keep it updated whenever structure or tooling changes.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20.x** (see `.nvmrc`; run `nvm use` if you use nvm)
- **npm 10+** (bundled with Node 20)
- Optional: `npx playwright install` (one-time) to run the smoke e2e tests

### Setup

```bash
npm install             # install dependencies
npm run dev             # dev server with HMR at http://localhost:3000

# Optional environment override for subdirectory deploys
echo "VITE_BASE_PATH=/your-path/" > .env

npm run build           # production build (outputs to dist/)
npm run preview         # serve built files at http://127.0.0.1:4173
```

For a static preview without the toolchain you can open `index.html` directly in a browser, but service worker behaviour, ES modules, and page transitions require the dev/preview server.

---

## 🧱 Architecture Highlights

- **Static HTML pages:** `index`, `about`, `services`, `projects`, `pricing`, `seo-services`, `contact`, plus a dedicated `reports.html` dashboard.
- **HTML Includes:** Navigation and footer are modularized via `partials/navbar.html` and `partials/footer.html`, included at build time using a custom Vite plugin (`vite-plugin-html-include.js`). Pages use `<!-- include partials/navbar.html -->` comments which are processed during the build.
- **CSS:** Modular imports from `main.css` with strict ordering (variables → base → components → pages → utilities). Animations/utilities live under `css/utils/` with `responsive.css` last for overrides.
- **JavaScript:** `js/main.js` wires 10 core modules (navigation, scroll manager, animations, cursor, mouse tilt, easter egg, page transitions, service worker, three.js hero, performance) and conditionally boots page modules (`contact`, `services`, `projects`, `reports`). Navigation active states are handled dynamically by `js/core/navigation.js`.
- **Background video lazy-load:** `js/utils/ripples-lazyload.js` swaps hero/background video sources based on connection speed, viewport width, and codec support, only loading media once the container enters the viewport.
- **Page transitions:** A sessionStorage-backed preload flow (`js/core/page-transitions.js`) coordinates the blur/fade animation and relies on a small inline script in each HTML head to avoid flashes on navigation.
- **Assets:** Self-hosted fonts (WOFF2 subsets), optimised images (WebP/AVIF) with responsive variants, and pre-optimised hero videos.
- **PWA:** `sw.js` handles caching and update prompts; `site.webmanifest` defines install metadata; comprehensive favicon implementation (SVG, multiple PNG sizes, ICO fallback, Apple Touch Icon, Windows Tiles, Safari Pinned Tab) ensures proper branding across all platforms and devices.
- **Reports dashboard:** `reports.html` surfaces bundle treemap/raw stats, synthetic coverage, Lighthouse, PWA audit, accessibility audit, media inventory, and legacy `stats.html` in a tabbed iframe interface.

---

## 📊 Reports Dashboard Overview

The reports hub (`reports.html`) is designed to be opened after running the reporting scripts. Tabs are **lazy-loaded** and show a placeholder until their backing artefact is present:

- **Bundle Treemap** → `dist/reports/bundle-report.html` (from `npm run build` via rollup-plugin-visualizer).
- **Bundle Raw Stats** → `dist/reports/bundle-stats.json` (also from `npm run build`).
- **Coverage** → `dist/reports/coverage/index.html` generated by `npm run reports:coverage`.
  - This is a *route coverage snapshot* derived from URLs hit inside `tests/e2e/smoke.spec.js`.
- **Lighthouse** → `dist/reports/lighthouse-report.html` from the main Lighthouse CI run inside `npm run reports:dashboard`.
- **Performance Timeline** → currently points at `dist/reports/lighthouse-report.html` as a convenient performance-focused view of the main Lighthouse report.
- **PWA Audit** → `dist/reports/pwa-audit.html`, produced by a PWA-only Lighthouse run (`lighthouserc.pwa.json`) inside `npm run reports:dashboard`.
- **Accessibility Audit** → `dist/reports/seo-audit.html`, which embeds Pa11y output from `reports/seo-pa11y.html` generated by `npm run reports:pa11y` (called by `reports:dashboard`).
- **Media Inventory** → `dist/reports/media-inventory.html` from `npm run reports:media`.
- **/stats.html** → `dist/reports/stats.html`, a mirrored copy of `dist/stats.html` for legacy bundle analysis.

Recommended one-shot refresh:

```bash
npm run reports:all
npm run preview
# then open http://127.0.0.1:4173/reports.html
```

## 🔬 Testing & QA

- **Playwright smoke suite** (`tests/e2e/smoke.spec.js`) covers:
  - Global navigation (desktop + mobile drawer)
  - Back-to-top + scroll progress synchronisation
  - Services modal open/close (button + keyboard/Escape)
  - Contact form validation (happy path + error states)
  - Service worker registration flow
- **Manual utilities:**
  - `http://localhost:3000/tests/test-service-worker.html`
  - `http://localhost:3000/tests/test-fonts.html`
- **Setup:** Run `npx playwright install` once before using `npm run test:e2e`.

- **Favicons:** Complete favicon implementation with SVG (modern browsers), multiple PNG sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64), ICO fallback (legacy browsers), Apple Touch Icon (iOS), Windows Tiles (browserconfig.xml), Safari Pinned Tab, and Web App Manifest integration for optimal branding across all platforms.
- **Accessibility:** Skip links, ARIA live region, focus management, keyboard navigation, `prefers-reduced-motion` support, and an `accessibility.js` helper module.
- **Analytics & Performance:** Plausible is wired in, with additional Web Vitals reporting from `js/utils/performance.js`.

## 📌 Notes

- The **Reports** dashboard is intentionally treated as an internal tool: it's not in the main navigation and is expected to be driven by CI/local scripts.
- When adding or relocating files, update `.cursor/rules/cursorrules.mdc` and relevant docs so they stay in sync with the actual codebase.
- New pages must include the inline page-transition preload snippet in `<head>` (see `.cursor/rules/cursorrules.mdc`) so the blur/fade effect stays seamless.
- **HTML Includes:** Navigation and footer are managed via `partials/navbar.html` and `partials/footer.html`. Use `<!-- include partials/navbar.html -->` and `<!-- include partials/footer.html -->` in HTML files. Active navigation states are handled dynamically by JavaScript, so no page-specific variants are needed.
