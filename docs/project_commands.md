# Project Commands Reference

Quick reference for common commands and tasks in the Logi-Ink project.

## 🚀 Development

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Build for GitHub Pages (relative assets + SW disabled)
npm run build:gh-pages

# Build GitHub Pages bundle in dist-gh-pages/ (CI artefact)
npm run build:gh-pages:ci

# Produce both standard and GitHub Pages bundles
npm run build:dual

# Preview production build (http://127.0.0.1:4173/)
npm run preview

# Clean dist/ and Vite cache
npm run clean
```

> `npm run clean` uses `rm -rf`; on Windows run via Git Bash/WSL or substitute with `rimraf` if needed.

## 🛠️ Optimisation & Utilities

```bash
# Compress and optimise existing images
npm run optimize-images

# Generate responsive AVIF/WebP sets + HTML snippets
npm run responsive-images

# Optimise hero/background videos + poster frames
npm run optimize-video

# Analyse font usage prior to subsetting
npm run subset-fonts

# Inline critical CSS (run after build)
npm run inline-critical-css

# Rebuild sitemap.xml from current routes
npm run generate-sitemap

# Generate media inventory HTML + JSON under reports/
npm run reports:media
```

## 📊 Reports & Dashboard

The operational reports dashboard lives at `reports.html` (built to `dist/reports.html`). It is **not linked from the main navigation**; open it directly (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:4173/reports.html`).

### One-shot refresh

```bash
# Build, run Lighthouse (main + PWA) + Pa11y, rebuild media inventory,
# run Playwright smoke tests, regenerate coverage + performance timeline,
# then rebuild so dist/reports/ is fully up to date.
npm run reports:all
```

### Individual report scripts

```bash
# Run Lighthouse CI (main config) – emits HTML + JSON into .lighthouseci/
npm run reports:lighthouse

# Run Pa11y accessibility audit – writes reports/seo-pa11y.html
npm run reports:pa11y

# Generate route coverage snapshot – writes reports/coverage/index.html
npm run reports:coverage

# Generate performance timeline from the latest Lighthouse JSON – writes reports/performance-timeline.html
npm run reports:performance

# Generate media inventory dashboard + JSON – writes reports/media-inventory.{html,json}
npm run reports:media

# Orchestrate Vite preview + Lighthouse (main + PWA) + Pa11y,
# then sync reports/lighthouse-report.html, reports/pwa-audit.html, and reports/seo-audit.html
npm run reports:dashboard

# OPTIONAL: Run PWMetrics and emit pwmetrics.{json,html} under reports/
# (not wired into the reports dashboard UI; for ad-hoc analysis)
npm run reports:pwmetrics
```

Typical manual flow if `reports:all` fails or you want to see intermediate outputs:

```bash
npm run build
npm run reports:dashboard
npm run reports:media
npm run reports:coverage
npm run reports:performance
npm run test:e2e:only
npm run build
```

Then:

```bash
npm run preview
# open http://127.0.0.1:4173/reports.html
```

## 🧹 Quality Gates

```bash
# Format with Prettier
npm run format

# Check formatting only
npm run format:check

# Lint ES modules (js/**/*.js)
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix

# Run format check + lint sequentially
npm run validate
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run Playwright smoke tests (builds production output first)
npm run test:e2e

# Run Playwright suite without rebuilding (assumes a fresh build already exists)
npm run test:e2e:only

# Install Playwright browsers (first run only)
npx playwright install
```

Manual QA helpers:

- `http://localhost:3000/tests/test-service-worker.html`
- `http://localhost:3000/tests/test-fonts.html`

Coverage: multi-page navigation (desktop + mobile drawer), scroll progress/back-to-top, services modal lifecycle, contact form validation (happy + invalid), service worker registration toast.

## 📝 Common Tasks

### Adding a New Component

1. Create CSS in `css/components/component-name.css`.
2. Import it in `css/main.css`.
3. If JS is required, add a module in `js/core/` or `js/utils/`.
4. Export an `init...` function and wire it up in `js/main.js`.
5. Update `.cursor/rules/cursorrules.mdc` with the new structure.

### Modifying Colors

- Edit `css/variables.css` only (all components reference tokens).

### Adding a New Page

1. Create the HTML file at the repository root.
2. Add page-specific CSS in `css/pages/` if needed.
3. Add page-specific JS in `js/pages/` if required.
4. Import the CSS in `css/main.css`.
5. Conditionally initialise the JS in `js/main.js`.
6. Include the page-transition preload snippet in `<head>` (see `.cursor/rules/cursorrules.mdc`).
7. Use HTML includes for navigation and footer:
   - Add `<!-- include partials/navbar.html -->` where navigation should appear
   - Add `<!-- include partials/footer.html -->` where footer should appear
   - Active navigation states are handled automatically by `js/core/navigation.js`

## 🔧 Build Configuration

- `vite.config.js` – multipage build pipeline, plugins, compression, manual chunks, report copying.
- `postcss.config.cjs` – PurgeCSS scaffold (disabled by default; review safelist first).
- `package.json` – scripts and dependency manifest.
- `eslint.config.js` – ESLint v9 flat config.
- `playwright.config.js` – Playwright webServer + device matrix.
